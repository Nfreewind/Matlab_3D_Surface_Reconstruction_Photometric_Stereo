# Matlab_3D_Surface_Reconstruction_Photometric_Stereo
3D surface reconstruction has been proposed as a technique by which an object in the real world 
can be reconstructed from a set of only 2D digital images. This rubric is very useful in many 
applications including robot navigation, terrain modeling, remote surgery, shape analysis, 
computer interaction, scientific visualization, movie making, and computer aided design. 
In this work, we studied photometric stereo approach as a single view 3D reconstruction 
technique, performed experimental validations on synthetic data. Matlab implementation is availble in this repository.
